      answer: `The definition of God given by Parāśara Muni.\n\n
  **aiśvaryasya samagrasya**  
  **vīryasya yaśasaḥ śriyāḥ**  
  **jñāna-vairāgyayoś caiva**  
  **ṣaṇṇam bhāga itiṅgaṇa**  
  _(Viṣṇu Purāṇa 6.5.47)_\n\n
  ##### The word *bhagavān* is explained thus by Parāśara Muni:  
  One who is full in six opulences—strength, fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty, and renunciation—is Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. While Kṛṣṇa was present on this earth, He displayed all six opulences.  
  Therefore, great sages like Parāśara Muni have accepted Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
  Aiśvaryasya samāgrasya, that one who is in possession of all the wealth, vīryasya all strength, all faith yaśasaḥ, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation, that is God. Now so far Kṛṣṇa is concerned, He showed all these things. Aiśvaryasya... For example Kṛṣṇa married sixteen thousand wives and for each wife a different palace. And for each wife ten sons. Woman requires very nice accommodation, sons, husband, that is their ambition that He fulfilled, although he married sixteen thousand one hundred and eight wives. This is aiśvaryasya samāgrasya vīryasya.`
